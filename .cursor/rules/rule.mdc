Use Go language and Ebitengine (github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/v2)

Also use Bamenn (github.com/noppikinatta/bamenn)

## This project is the game for the Game Jam

I must submit the game until a week, ignore a little hard code or lack of expandability

## Develop with TDD

Develop with TDD.

1. Write feature and test list on .tdd.md
2. Develop red green refactor cycle

The actual operation is checked by a human and issues are added
