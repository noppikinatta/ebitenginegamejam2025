## This project is Go + Ebitengine game

Use Go language and Ebitengine (github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/v2)

Also use Bamenn (github.com/noppikinatta/bamenn)

## This project is the game for the Game Jam

I must submit the game until a week, ignore a little hard code or lack of expandability

## You do not have to actually run with `go run` to see how it works.

The actual operation is checked by a human and issues are added

## Test codes and testdata must be in same package

For example, test codes for core/battle.go must be in core/battle_test.go

Package name for test codes must have traling `_test`, for example, test code files for `core` package starts with `package core_test`

Directory for test data also must be in same package, core/testdata/ stores test data for `core` package
